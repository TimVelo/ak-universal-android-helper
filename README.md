# ak-universal-android-helper
A helper library to ease the most repetitive codes with simple reusable attributes.

AKUAH can help you with many repetitive tasks of daily life development.

I am using this library in my own projects from quit a time. Now I decided to share in for public use. 
I have not implemented all the features I used to have in my old library but will keep adding them and some new features. 

Currently this library contains following features.
